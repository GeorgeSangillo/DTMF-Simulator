# DTMF-Simulator
DTMF Simulator to encode and decode for DSP

## Abstract
Many telephones use a dual tone multi frequency (DTMF) scheme to encode key-presses as audio tones and vice versa for decoding. In the following report, the methods for decoding a sequence of key presses are investigated and implemented. This is done using Digital Signal Processing (DSP) concepts and MATLAB.
