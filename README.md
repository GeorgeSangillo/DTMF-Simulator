# DTMF-Simulator
DTMF Simulator to encode and decode for DSP

### Abstract
Many telephones use a dual tone multi frequency (DTMF) scheme to encode key-presses as audio tones and vice versa for decoding. In the following report, the methods for decoding a sequence of key presses are investigated and implemented. This is done using Digital Signal Processing (DSP) concepts and MATLAB.

The full paper for this project can be found [here](./DTMF_Simulator_Project_Report.pdf).

## Requirements
The aim of this project is to investigate and implement methods for
decoding a sequence of key presses, such as may occur when a complete telephone number
is dialed, and in the presence of noise (a real world occurrence).
As a simulator, the project must encode the key presses and simulate noise into the digital signal. Then it must be able to decode this digital signal to provide the original key presses.
